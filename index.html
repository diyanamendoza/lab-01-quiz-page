            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>
            It's most likely that ramen was introduced to Japan by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th century in Yokohama's Chinatown. 
            In 1910, the first ramen shop (called Rairaiken, 来々軒) opened in Asakusa, Tokyo, where the Japanese owner employed 12 Chinese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown.
            Early versions of ramen were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork. The word ramen is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese word, la mian (拉麵), which translates to "hand-pulled noodles".

            <h2>Traditional Flavors</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>Shōyu (醤油, "soy sauce")</h3>
                    <p>
                    This type has a clear brown broth, based on a chicken and vegetable (or sometimes fish or beef) stock with plenty of soy sauce.
                    Shōyu ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, but this is not always the case.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h3>Shio (塩,"salt")</h3>
                    <p>This is the oldest type, and has a pale, clear, yellowish broth made with plenty of salt and any combination of chicken, vegetables, fish, and seaweed. 
                    Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long as they are for tonkotsu ramen, so the soup remains light and clear.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h3>Miso (味噌</h3>
                    <p>
                    Miso is a relative newcomer, having reached national prominence around 1965. 
                    This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was developed in Sapporo Hokkaido, features a broth that combines miso with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with tonkotsu or lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup.
